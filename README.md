# Open-Greek-SinginDataset
a base AI SVS Model Training dataset capable of the Greek language, used in "A-MAIN -DS MODE-" as well as included striged samples of my dedicated Greek CVVC reclist.

Phonemes are labelled according to SAMPA Greek phonemes, with additions of [rr] and [ll], as well as conventional DS-specific phonemes.

All audio in this dataset was recorded using an AT2020USB-XP, and most samples have been treated with a noise gate and limiter.

The data is in 16 bit WAV, 44.1 KHZ, and mono.
