# Open-Greek-SinginDataset
a base AI SVS Model Training dataset and support files capable of the Greek language, used in "A-MAIN -DS MODE-" as well as included striged samples of my dedicated Greek CVVC reclist.

Phonemes are labelled according to X-SAMPA, with additions of [rr] and [ll], [y] replacing the default [j] and [jj], the romanized but optional [ks] and [ps] for extra coverage, as well as conventional DiffSinger-specific phonemes (or NNSVS ones).

All audio in this dataset was recorded using an AT2020USB-XP, and most samples have been treated with noise reduction and a limiter.

The audio data is in 16 bit WAV, 44.1 KHZ, and mono.

By utilizing this dataset, you agree to the following terms:

**DO'S**:
